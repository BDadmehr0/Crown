# Crown : Secure C/C++ to Rust Code Converter

## Description
Crown is an innovative tool designed to convert legacy C and C++ codebases into secure and efficient Rust code. With Rust gaining traction for its superior memory management and safety features, Crown helps developers seamlessly migrate their existing projects to Rust, enabling them to take advantage of its performance and security benefits without rewriting everything from scratch.

The converter analyzes C/C++ code to identify common patterns and constructs, automatically transforming them into their secure, idiomatic Rust equivalents. In cases where automatic conversion might fall short, Crown also generates detailed reports highlighting sections that require manual review.

## Features
- **Code Analysis:** Parses C/C++ code to identify language structures and common idioms.
- **Automatic Conversion:** Translates recognized patterns into secure Rust code.
- **Review Reporting:** Flags code sections that might need manual adjustments for enhanced safety.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides a user-friendly interface for easy integration into existing workflows.

## Benefits
- **Effortless Migration:** Simplifies the process of transitioning legacy C/C++ projects to Rust.
- **Enhanced Safety:** Leverages Rust's robust safety features to improve code reliability.
- **Improved Performance:** Reduces memory management errors and enhances overall code stability.

## Getting Started
*Installation and usage instructions will be provided soon.*
